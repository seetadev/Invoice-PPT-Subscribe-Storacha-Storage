# Run all tests in this directory
npx vitest run .github/claude/tests

# Run tests with coverage
npx vitest run .github/claude/tests --coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npx vitest .github/claude/tests
```

### Running Specific Test Files

```bash
# Run a specific test file
npx vitest run .github/claude/tests/specific-test.test.ts
```

## 📊 Test Coverage

Target coverage: **80%**

To check coverage for these tests:

```bash
npx vitest run .github/claude/tests --coverage
```

## 🔧 Test Configuration

### Framework: vitest

Vitest is a Vite-native testing framework that's fast and modern.
- Compatible with Jest API but faster
- Native TypeScript support
- Uses vi.mock() for mocking
- Built-in coverage reporting

## 📝 Test Structure

Each test file follows these conventions:

- **Descriptive test names** that explain what is being tested
- **Proper setup and teardown** for clean test environments
- **Mocked dependencies** for isolated testing
- **Edge case testing** for robust error handling
- **Clear assertions** that validate expected behavior

## 🎯 Test Types Generated


- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual functions and methods in isolation
- **Component Tests**: Testing React components with user interactions
- **Integration Tests**: Testing component interactions and data flow
- **Service Tests**: Testing API calls and business logic
            

## 🔄 Maintenance

### Adding New Tests

1. Follow the existing naming conventions
2. Place tests in appropriate subdirectories
3. Use the same testing patterns and setup
4. Update this README if you add new categories

### Updating Tests

When source code changes:

1. Review related test files
2. Update test cases as needed
3. Ensure coverage targets are maintained
4. Run the full test suite to ensure no regressions

## 🐛 Debugging Tests

### Common Issues

1. **Import errors**: Check that all dependencies are installed
2. **Mock failures**: Verify that mocks match the actual API
3. **Async issues**: Ensure proper async/await handling
4. **Environment setup**: Check test environment configuration

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Run tests with verbose output
npx vitest run --reporter=verbose

# Run tests with debugging
npx vitest --inspect-brk
```
